## Introduction

In the modern applications, backend services hold a vital role, especially in managing dynamic data, implementing user authentication, and ensuring robust data storage. 
Below, the significance of backend services within the context of a weather location-based application, particularly focusing on the functionality of saving favourite locations, is examined. This analysis extends to its relevance within a travel information app. Additionally, specific features such as the implementation of JWT tokens for authentication are considered, highlighting the importance of ensuring secure access and efficient data management.

## Problems that the backend services solve 

### Data Persistence
 Backend services empower the application to store user data persistently, ensuring accessibility to weather information for favourite locations even after the user closes the application or restarts their devices.
### User Authentication
 Backend services establish a secure authentication mechanism, safeguarding user data and granting exclusive access to authenticated users. Using JWT tokens enhances security and efficiency in authentication processes. Only authenticated users can create and access their favourite locations and view the weather forecast for those specific locations, ensuring appropriate information delivery based on user needs and enhancing overall system integrity.
### Data Management
 Backend services serve as a centralized platform for handling data-related tasks such as adding or removing favourite locations and retrieving weather forecasts for those favourites. This enables seamless synchronization of changes across all user devices.


## Backend services benefits for users

### Reliability
 Backend services ensure users can seamlessly access weather forecasts for their favourite locations across multiple devices, maintaining consistency across various platforms.

### Security
 The weather forecast for favourite locations benefits from robust protection mechanisms like secure storage and encryption, ensuring confidentiality, particularly regarding sensitive data like passwords, which are salted and encrypted before being saved in the database. Additionally, only authenticated users can access their favourite locations and weather forecasts, reassuring trust in the safety of personal information.

### Real-time Updates
 Backend services enable instant communication between the server and user device, ensuring that any changes made to location details are quickly shown on their screen.

## Backend services impact on customer's business

### Scalability
 Engineered to manage rising demands, backend services ensure seamless scalability that mirrors the customer's business expansion. This establishes a reliable foundation for future growth and development initiatives.

### Customer Satisfaction
 Through delivering a secure, consistent, and real-time user experience, backend services notably elevate satisfaction levels by ensuring reliable weather forecasts for favourite locations and safeguarding sensitive data with JWT token security measures, fostering trustworthiness and retention.

### Business Intelligence
Leveraging data collected by backend services yields valuable insights into user preferences and behaviours regarding favourite locations. This informs strategic business decisions, ultimately improving operational efficiency and effectiveness across the board.

## Summary 
Backend services play a crucial role in resolving various challenges faced by applications, including data persistence, user authentication, and data management. Through features like persistent storage and secure authentication using JWT tokens, backend services ensure reliability, security, and real-time updates for users. These benefits translate into enhanced customer satisfaction and scalability for the business, while also providing valuable insights for informed decision-making through collected data.
